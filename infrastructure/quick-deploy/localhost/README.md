In addition to above instructions explaining how to deploy ArmoniK and its needed resources, You can use a script
bash [deploy-dev-test-infra.sh](../../utils/scripts/deploy-dev-test-infra.sh) to automate the deployment on your local
machine.

You have a PowerShell script [armonik_dev_environement.ps1](../../utils/scripts/armonik_dev_environment.ps1) too for
WSL2 machine that allows You to install the prerequisites and ArmoniK.

You can find the usage of the script Bash in [Script bash all-in-one](../../docs/all-in-one-deploy.md) and the usage of
the script PowerShell in [Script PowerShell all-in-one](../../docs/all-in-one-deploy-powershell.md).
