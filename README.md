ArmoniK is an open-source platform and programming model for writing and executing scalable, fault-tolerant parallel and distributed workloads. ArmoniK brings the simplicity and flexibility of serverless computing to complex and compute-intensive applications across cloud or on-premises infrastructures.

With ArmoniK, developers can run distributed workloads made up of millions of tasks using many programming languages (C++, C#, Java, Python, Rust, etc.), without worrying about the low-level orchestration, data shuffling, or failure recovery mechanisms.

## What is ArmoniK

### Overview

ArmoniK is designed to execute workloads described asÂ dynamic task graphs in a fault-tolerant, cloud-agnostic, and language-agnostic environment. It scales effortlessly to thousands of cores and adapts to failures like task failures, node crashes and network disrupt, making it ideal for high-performance, business-critical workloads.

Example use cases include:
* Scientific and financial simulations
* Machine learning pipelines
* Video and signal processing
* Iterative algorithms

One of ArmoniK key feature is subtasking: tasks can dynamically generate new tasks at runtime, enabling DAG reshaping and adaptive workflows.

### Architecture

ArmoniK follows a modular architecture made of stateless services and pluggable components. The architecture can be tuned to meet specific requirements like: performance, cost-efficiency, company-specific rules, etc.

The following figure shows an abstract view of ArmoniK's architecture.

[Insert figure]

* Storage: Consists of a database (e.g., MongoDB) and object store (e.g., S3, MinIO) to persists execution state.
* Message Queue: Drives event-based execution (e.g., RabbitMQ, Redis, SQS).
* Submitter: Gateway for job submissions and monitoring.
* Scheduling Agents: Control task lifecycle, data flow, and error handling.
* Workers: Run user-defined code for executing tasks. 

### Deployment

ArmoniK official deployments include:
* Cloud: AWS, GCP and any cloud-based Kubernetes environment.
* On-premises: Bare metal or private Kubernetes clusters
* Local: Lightweight setup for development

### What is this repository?

This repository serves as the entry point for the ArmoniK ecosystem. It contains:
* Useful scripts.
* Terraform templates and deployment samples for:
    * Local setup
    * AWS (EKS, S3, etc.)
    * GCP (GKE, Pub/Sub, etc.)
    * On-prem Kubernetes
