<em>ArmoniK</em> is a high throughput compute grid project using Kubernetes. The project provides a reference
architecture that can be used to build and adapt a modern high throughput compute solution on-premise or using Cloud
services, allowing users to submit high volumes of short and long-running tasks and scaling environments dynamically.
