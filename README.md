ArmoniK is an open-source high throughput compute grid built on Kubernetes. It provides a scalable and robust framework for running large volumes of compute tasks.

## Introduction

ArmoniK allows users to submit high volumes of short and long-running compute tasks, while dynamically scaling the underlying infrastructure to meet demand. It is designed as a reference architecture that can be deployed on-premise or in the cloud.

The project aims to provide a modern, Kubernetes-native solution for high performance computing applications. 

## What is ArmoniK?

ArmoniK consists of several components:

- A control plane for handling task submission and coordination
- A scalable compute plane for running tasks  
- Integrations with storage, networking, monitoring, and other services
- Client libraries and tools for interfacing with the system

Together, these components allow ArmoniK to accept compute tasks, distribute them to workers, execute the tasks, and return results. The architecture is horizontally scalable, fault tolerant, and provides detailed monitoring.

## When should I use ArmoniK? 

ArmoniK is designed for workloads that require:

- High throughput of compute tasks
- Dynamic scaling of resources 
- Low overhead and high efficiency
- Detailed monitoring and analytics   
- Integration of on-premise and cloud infrastructure
- Static or dynamic graph of tasks creation and then tasks creation itself
- Communicate with ArmoniK through 11 different languages via gRPC APIs
- Admin GUI for monitoring
- Enterprise security compliance
- Client-server communications, roles and permissions controlled by mutual TLS authentication 
- Ability to partition resources (hardware, software, application versions)
- Extensions provide abstraction from the orchestrator, some resemble known APIs to facilitate integration
- Ability to leverage Linux, Windows, CPU, GPU resources
- Cloud provider agnostic while utilizing cloud provider services  
- Activity log visualization via fluent-bit connectors
- Resource and task monitoring via Grafana, Prometheus, Admin GUI

Use cases include:

- Scientific computing / HPC
- Financial analysis
- Machine learning / data processing   
- Video encoding / transcoding 
- Genomics / bioinformatics
- Rendering / graphics
- Any batch processing workload
