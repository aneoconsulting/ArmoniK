# Kubernetes installation

Hereafter we describe the instructions to install Kubernetes on an onpremise cluster. We present two examples of Kubernetes on Linux cluster machines:

## [AWS and K3s installation](xref:aws_k3s_deploy)

Installation using K3s as kubernetes implementation.

## [AWS and kubeadm installation](xref:aws_kubeadm_deploy)

Installation using kubeadm.

# ArmoniK installation

## Single server installation (developement only)

These documentations are giving indications on how to create a first time environment for a developer and/or a test plateform. This is not the documentation that should be used to deploy on a the cloud or on-premise cluster.

### [Windows Subsytem Linux Installation](xref:all_in_one_deploy_powershell)

Process to install ArmoniK using WSL on windows. 

### [Ubuntu Linux 18.04 and 20.04 Installation](xref:all_in_one_deploy_linux)

Step by step documentation to install ArmoniK and its prerequisites on a Linux system (single server). This documentation can be used as a base to install ArmoniK on another Linux distribution.

## [How-To test ArmoniK installation](Tests/simple_tests.md)

Some simple test to validate ArmoniK installation
