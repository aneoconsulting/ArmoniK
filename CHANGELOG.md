So modifications are done in the Fluent-bit module to fix the following warning:
```bash
╷
│ Warning: "default_secret_name" is no longer applicable for Kubernetes v1.24.0 and above
│
│ with module.fluent_bit.kubernetes_service_account.fluent_bit[0],
│ on ../../../modules/monitoring/fluent-bit/service-account.tf line 2, in resource "kubernetes_service_account" "fluent_bit":
│ 2: resource "kubernetes_service_account" "fluent_bit" {
│
│ Starting from version 1.24.0 Kubernetes does not automatically generate a token for service accounts, in this case, "default_secret_name" will be empty
```
In Fluent-bit module, we have replaced `kubernetes_service_account` by `kubernetes_manifest`.

Changed
-

* Update Core version from 0.7.1 to 0.8.2
* Update Extensions.Csharp version from 0.7.5 to 0.8.1
* **Breaking** : Namespaces in Extensions.Csharp have changed : 
    * The namespaces are now organised in the following form : 
    `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.[Common|Client|Worker].[Common|Symphony|GridServer|Unified]`
    * For example, this means that the namespace `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.SymphonyApi.Client` is now `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.Client.Symphony`
    * Unified api is now explicitely named as Unified (`ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.Worker[.Grid]` is now `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.Worker.Unified`, and `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.Client` is now `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.Worker.Unified`)
    * Namespace `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.WorkerApi.Common` is now `ArmoniK.DevelopmentKit.Worker.Common`
    * As a result, the nuget names have changed
    * The motivations and details for this change are available [here](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK/issues/537)

      ```
    * **Option 2:** Replace `apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1`
      by `client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1` in your `~/.kube/config`
      ```bash
      diff ~/.kube/config ~/.kube/config-backup
      <             apiVersion: client.authentication.k8s.io/v1beta1
