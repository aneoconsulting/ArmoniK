# ArmoniK

ArmoniK is a high throughput compute grid project using Kubernetes.

It provides a reference architecture that can be used to build and adapt a modern high throughput compute solution on-premise or using Cloud services, allowing users to submit high volumes of short and long-running tasks and scaling environments dynamically.

## When should I use ArmoniK

ArmoniK should be used when the following criteria are met:

1. A high task throughput is required (from 250 to 10,000+ tasks per second).
2. The tasks are loosely coupled.
3. Variable workloads (tasks with heterogeneous execution times) are expected and the solution needs to dynamically scale with the load.
