# Populate database

This guide will explain you how you can populate your ArmoniK database with **fake data**.

::alert{type="info"}
This guide is useful for the [Admin GUI](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.Admin.GUI) or for testing purpose.

## Prerequisites

You need to have a running ArmoniK cluster. If you don't have one, please follow the [Getting Started](../1.installation/1.linux/1.installation.md) guide.

## Functioning

In order to be easily populate database with [MongoDB scripts](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/write-scripts/) along the [@faker-js/faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) library.

This method allows use to write JavaScript scripts to populate database without having to write dump files manually and insert them with the `mongoimport` command.

::alert{type="info"}
Data are generated randomly, so you can run the script multiple times to generate different data.
::

### Run scripts

1. Go to the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

    ```sh
    ./tools/mongodb/<script-name>.sh
    ```

### Available scripts

| Script name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `export-all` | Export all collections in the `.database` folder. |
| `generate-partitions` | Generate 100 partitions |

## Going further

The section is only needed if you can't find your joy with current scripts.

We provide a strong base of utils scripts to write your own script.

First, you can check [current scripts](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK/tree/main/tools/mongodb) to see how it works.

Then, you can read the MongoDB documentation to learn how to write your own script.

Finally, we recommend you to use [execute-script.sh](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK/blob/main/tools/mongodb/execute-script.sh) to have the correct setup.

### Writing your own script

1. Create a file in the `mongodb` folder. Please name it with the following pattern: `<action>-<collection>.sh`.
2. Use the following command:

    ```sh
    # Description: <description with only a couple of words>
    $(pwd)/tools/mongodb/utils/execute-script.sh <script-name>
    ```

3. Create your JavaScript script in the `scripts` folder. Please name it with the following pattern: `<action>-<collection>.js`. (Same name as the file created in step 1)
4. Write your script. You can use the [@faker-js/faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker) library to generate fake data.
5. _Voil√†_! You're good to go!

Of course, you are free to write use other script and to combine them. But **each script must have a single purpose** (for maintenance purpose, e.g. create a user, create an application, create a task, ...).
