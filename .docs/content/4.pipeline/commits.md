# Purpose of Lint PR Pipeline

The "Lint PR" pipeline in our repository is designed to enforce a specific naming convention for pull request (PR) titles. It ensures that PR titles follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which enhances consistency and clarity in our development workflow. Here's why we use this pipeline:

## 1. Consistent PR Titles

Consistency in PR titles is essential for effective collaboration and code review. This pipeline helps maintain a standardized format for PR titles, making it easier for reviewers and contributors to understand the purpose of each PR.

## 2. Error Prevention

By automatically checking and validating PR titles, the pipeline prevents PRs with incorrect or non-compliant titles from being merged. This reduces the risk of merging PRs with unclear or inaccurate descriptions.

## 3. User-Friendly Feedback

When a PR title doesn't meet the required convention, the pipeline provides clear and user-friendly feedback to the contributor. This feedback includes details about what needs to be adjusted, helping contributors make the necessary changes.
