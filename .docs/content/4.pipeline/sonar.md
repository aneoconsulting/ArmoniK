# Purpose of Sonar Analysis Pipeline

The Sonar Analysis pipeline in our repository serves a specific purpose in our development workflow. This pipeline is designed to analyze and assess the code quality of our project using SonarCloud. Here are the key reasons why we use this pipeline:

## 1. Continuous Code Quality Assessment

The Sonar Analysis pipeline is triggered automatically whenever a pull request is opened, edited, or synchronized. This ensures that our code quality is continuously assessed throughout the development process. By leveraging SonarCloud, we gain insights into code maintainability, security, and reliability.

## 2. Early Detection of Issues

By analyzing the code early in the development cycle, the pipeline helps us detect and address code quality issues promptly. This proactive approach reduces the likelihood of introducing code vulnerabilities, technical debt, or other issues that could impact the project's stability.

## 3. Data-Driven Improvement

SonarCloud provides detailed reports and metrics on code quality. The data generated by the pipeline allows us to make informed decisions and prioritize improvements based on the identified issues. This data-driven approach enhances our development process.

### Example: [sonar.yml](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.Extensions.Csharp/blob/main/.github/workflows/sonar.yml)

You can find an example of our Sonar Analysis pipeline configuration in our repository's workflow file. This configuration demonstrates how we set up the pipeline to analyze our code using SonarCloud. It includes steps for setting up the environment, caching dependencies, running the analysis, and more.

By using the Sonar Analysis pipeline, we ensure that our code maintains high standards of quality and reliability, ultimately delivering a better product to our users and minimizing technical debt.
