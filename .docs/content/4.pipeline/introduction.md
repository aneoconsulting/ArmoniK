# Introduction to Pipelines and Workflows in the Armonik Repository

The Armonik repository is a collaborative development space where our team works on an exciting project. At the heart of this development process are pipelines and workflows, which are essential elements of our working methodology. These workflows and pipelines have been carefully designed to optimize code management, developer collaboration, and the regular release of stable versions of our software.

## Similar Workflows for Efficient Management

One of the key features of our Armonik repository is the use of similar workflows for different components of the project. These workflows, while tailored to the specific needs of each component, follow a common basic structure. This consistent approach makes it easier to understand, maintain, and collaborate within our team.

Our standardized workflows include:

- **Work in Progress (WIP)**: This workflow focuses on ongoing contributions, allowing developers to collaborate on features and bug fixes. Code validations, automated tests, and code reviews are integral parts of this process.

- **Automated Testing**: A dedicated workflow for automated testing is triggered whenever a new contribution is submitted. This ensures that our code adheres to quality standards and functions correctly.

- **Continuous Deployment**: We use a continuous deployment workflow to automatically publish updates to our pre-production environment. This allows us to test new features in an environment close to production before release.
