# Purpose of Release Automation Pipelines

In our repositories, we rely on release automation pipelines to streamline the process of versioning, building, and distributing our software. These pipelines serve multiple crucial purposes:

## 1. Automated Version Management

Release automation pipelines automate the version management of our software. By following semantic versioning, we ensure that version numbers accurately reflect the changes made to the codebase. This simplifies tracking and understanding of what each version entails, whether it's a major release, a minor enhancement, or a bug fix.

## 2. Consistent Image and Package Building

Our pipelines automate the process of building Docker images and NuGet packages. This automation ensures that the correct versions of our software are consistently bundled into these artifacts. Users can confidently pull Docker images and packages knowing they correspond to stable and well-documented releases.

## 3. Backup of Correct Versions

Release automation pipelines play a vital role in safeguarding the correct versions of our software. By automating the tagging and versioning process, we reduce the risk of human error. In case of pipeline failures or cancellations, tags associated with incorrect versions are automatically removed, preventing confusion and ensuring that only valid versions are accessible.

### Example: [armonik-versions.txt](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK/blob/main/armonik-versions.txt)

Here is an example of a version log file from our repository that demonstrates the effectiveness of our release automation pipelines. This log file provides a clear history of version changes, helping us maintain transparency and traceability in our software development process.

By utilizing release automation pipelines and version management practices, we not only make our development and release processes more efficient but also enhance the reliability and consistency of our software distributions. This approach enables us to deliver high-quality software to our users while reducing the potential for versioning errors.
