# Hello World sample for each of the supported SDKs

## Prerequisites

### ArmoniK cluster

In order to run the sample, we assume that you have access to an ArmoniK cluster, for example the [local deployment](../quick-start/1.quick-installation.md).
Remember from that section, you should have the following information available:

```bash

Apply complete! Resources: 125 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
 Outputs:
 armonik = {
  "admin_app_url" = "http://10.100.1.166:5000/admin"
  "chaos_mesh_url" = null
  "control_plane_url" = "http://10.100.1.166:5001"
  "grafana_url" = "http://10.100.1.166:5000/grafana/"
  "seq_web_url" = "http://10.100.1.166:5000/seq/"
}

OUTPUT FILE: /home/ubuntu/ArmoniK/infrastructure/quick-deploy/localhost/generated/armonik-output.json
Run to point your ArmoniK CLI to this deployment:

------------------------------
export AKCONFIG=/home/ubuntu/ArmoniK/infrastructure/quick-deploy/localhost/generated/armonik-cli.yaml
```


### ArmoniK Samples repository


You will need to clone the [ArmoniK.Samples](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.Samples) to reproduce the steps
explained in this document. In the following we show how to launch the Hello World sample for each of the supported SDKs, 
that is, `C#`, `C++` and `Java`. The `Python` version has already been discussed in the [quick-start](../quick-start/2.helloworld.md) section.

## C# Sample

```{include} helloworld_csharp.md
```

## C++ Sample

```{include} helloworld_cpp.md
```

## Java Sample

```{include} helloworld_java.md
