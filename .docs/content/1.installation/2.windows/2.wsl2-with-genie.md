# WSL2 with genie

::alert{type="warning"}
This installation method is not recommended for production environments.
::

This installation will use [`genie`](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie). Genie is a tool which gives you a way to run systemd as pid 1. The usage of this tool will disable some Windows goodies within your Ubuntu distribution.

::alert{type="warning"}
We does not recommend to use this installation method, even for development environment since WSL2 support natively `systemd`. We recommend to use [WSL2 with systemd](./1.wsl2-with-systemd.md).
::

::alert{type="info"}
You must have installed WSL2 and Ubuntu before continuing. If you haven't, please refer to the [WSL2 installation](./0.installation-using-wsl2.md) method.
::

## Install genie

First, you need to update your packages:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

Then, you need to install `genie`:

```bash
cd /tmp
wget --content-disposition "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/djfdyuruiry/6720faa3f9fc59bfdf6284ee1f41f950/raw/952347f805045ba0e6ef7868b18f4a9a8dd2e47a/install-sg.sh"
chmod +x install-sg.sh
./install-sg.sh
rm install-sg.sh
```

::alert{type="info"}
Please, read the [script `install-sg.sh`](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/djfdyuruiry/6720faa3f9fc59bfdf6284ee1f41f950/raw/952347f805045ba0e6ef7868b18f4a9a8dd2e47a/install-sg.sh) before executing it.
::

Finally, in order to avoid some issues, you need to mask some services.

```bash
sudo systemctl mask systemd-remount-fs.service getty@tty1.service multipathd.service multipathd.socket ssh.service
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can find more information about this issue on the [genie documentation](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie#warning-timing-out).
::

Then, you need to exit your Ubuntu distribution and restart it.

```bash
exit
```

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```

## Start session

Because `genie` must be start as PID 1, you need to start a session with `genie`.

```bash
wsl genie -s
```

`-s` is used to initialize the bottle (if necessary), and run a shell in it. You can find more options on the [genie documentation](https://github.com/arkane-systems/genie#usage).

::alert{type="info"}
If you have multiple WSL2, you can specify the distribution name with `wsl -d <distro_name> genie -s`.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
Starting a WSL2 session with `wsl` alone will not create the session within the `genie` namespace, and thus services like Docker or Kubernetes will not behave as expected. **Be careful**.
::

## Install ArmoniK

::alert{type="warning"}
Be carefull, you must enable `genie` support before installing ArmoniK.
::

First, clone the ArmoniK repository (inside your home directory from WSL2 Ubuntu distribution):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK.git
```

Then, you can install ArmoniK following the [Linux installation instructions](../1.linux/1.installation.md).
