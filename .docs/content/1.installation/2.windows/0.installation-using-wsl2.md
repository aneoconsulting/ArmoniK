# Installation using WSL2

::alert{type="warning"}
This installation method is not recommended for production environments.
::

ArmoniK can be installed on Windows 10 and 11 using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). The following instructions will guide you through the installation process.

::alert{type="info"}
You can read more about WSL2 on the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions).
::

## Install WSL2

::alert{type="warning"}
You must stop Docker Desktop before installing WSL2. Removing Docker Desktop is not required but recommended.
::

To install WSL2, open the Windows Store and install the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P9TQF7MRM4R) application.

::alert{type="info"}
If you are unable to use the store version, please refer to the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Please, **install WSL2 (not WSL1)**. We do not support WSL1.
::

## Install Ubuntu LTS

::alert{type="warning"}
Currently, the LTS is the version 22.04. For Linux 20.04, please refer to the [WSL2 and Genie](./2.wsl2-with-genie.md) installation method.
::

Then you can install the Ubuntu distribution from the Windows Store. We recommend you to [install the latest LTS version](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PDXGNCFSCZV).

You can also install Ubuntu LTS manually by following the instructions.

```powershell [powershell]
wsl --install -d Ubuntu
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can read more about Ubuntu on the [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-6---install-your-linux-distribution-of-choice).
::

Once the installation is complete, verify the version of Ubuntu:

```powershell [powershell]
wsl -l -v
```

You should see something like this:

```powershell [powershell]
  NAME     STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu   Running         2
# or Ubuntu-22.04 depending if you install the LTS or a specific version
```

You can set the default WSL2 distro by using the following command:

```powershell [powershell]
wsl --set-default Ubuntu # or Ubuntu-22.04 depending if you install the LTS or a specific version
```

Then, you can start your Ubuntu distribution:

```powershell [powershell]
wsl -d Ubuntu # or Ubuntu-22.04 depending if you install the LTS or a specific version
```

Finally, you can update your packages:

```bash [shell]
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Configure WSL2

Then, you have 2 options to continue the installation:

- [WSL2 and systemd](../2.windows/1.wsl2-with-systemd.md)
- [WSL2 and Genie](../2.windows/2.wsl2-with-genie.md)

::alert{type="info"}
In order to have Docker and Kubernetes, we need to use `systemd`. WSL2 supports `systemd`natively but it is not enabled by default. You can also use `Genie` to enable `systemd` but it is not recommended.
