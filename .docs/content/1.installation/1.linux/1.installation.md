# Installation

Now that prerequisites are installed, you can install ArmoniK. In order to do that, we provide a script to deploy all the infrastructure in one command.

::alert{type="info"}
This installation will not enable authentification nor authorization. You can find more information about this in [the authentication and authorization](../../2.guide/1.how-to/how-to-configure-authentication.md) section.
::

## Setup environment variables

Before running the script, you must set environment variables.

From the root of the repository:

```bash [shell]
cd infrastructure/quick-deploy/localhost
```

Then, you can set environment variables in the file `envvars.sh`:

```bash [shell]
source envvars.sh
```

::alert{type="info"}
Please, read the file `envvars.sh` before running it.
::

## Deploy

Create data directory:

```bash [shell]
mkdir -p "${ARMONIK_SHARED_HOST_PATH}"
```

::alert{type="danger"}
If you do not create the data directory, the deployment will fail when the compute plane will try to mount the shared directory.
::

::alert{type="info"}
You can find why your pod doesn't start by using `kubectl describe pod <pod_name> -n armonik`.
::

Finally, you can run the script to deploy ArmoniK on your local machine:

```bash [shell]
make deploy-all
```

Now, you may have a coffee and wait for the end of the deployment. :coffee:

You will easily recognize the end of the deployment when you see the following message:

```hsl
armonik = {
  "admin_api_url" = "http://<your_ip>:5000/api"
  "admin_app_url" = "http://<your_ip>:5000/admin"
  "admin_old_url" = "http://<your_ip>:5000/old-admin"
  "control_plane_url" = "http://<your_ip>:5001"
  "grafana_url" = "http://<your_ip>:5000/grafana/"
  "seq_web_url" = "http://<your_ip>:5000/seq/"
}

```

You can also deploy each resource independently:

After setting the environment variables, the command creates a Kubernetes namespace:

```bash [shell]
make create-namespace
```

::alert{type="danger"}
If you do not create a Kubernetes namespace, the deployment will fail.
::

Now, you can deploy each resource independently :

```bash [shell]
make deploy-keda
```

```bash [shell]
make deploy-metrics-server
```

```bash [shell]
make deploy-storage
```

```bash [shell]
make deploy-monitoring
```

```bash [shell]
make deploy-armonik
```

::alert{type="info"}
The order matters because top level resources depend on the bottom level resources.
::

## Destroy

To destroy all the infrastructure, you can run the following command:

```bash [shell]
make destroy-all
```

::alert{type="warning"}
To reinstall, you must restart from [setup environment variables](#setup-environment-variables).
::

You can also destroy each resource independently:

```bash [shell]
make destroy-armonik
```

```bash [shell]
make destroy-monitoring
```

```bash [shell]
make destroy-storage
```

```bash [shell]
make destroy-metrics-server
```

```bash [shell]
make destroy-keda
```

::alert{type="info"}
The order matters. You must destroy the resources in the reverse order of the deployment.
::

## Clean

To clean all the generated files from the deployment, you can run the following command:

```bash [shell]
make clean-all
```

::alert{type="warning"}
To reinstall, you must restart from [setup environment variables](#setup-environment-variables).
::

You can also clean each resource independently:

```bash [shell]
make clean-armonik
```

```bash [shell]
make clean-monitoring
```

```bash [shell]
make clean-storage
```

```bash [shell]
make clean-metrics-server
```

```bash [shell]
make clean-keda
```

::alert{type="info"}
The order matters. You must clean the resources in the reverse order of the deployment.
