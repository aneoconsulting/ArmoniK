# Prerequisites

In order to install ArmoniK locally or on-premise, you must have a few of things installed on your machine.

## Installation

You can easily install all of them using the [ArmoniK prerequisites installer](https://github.com/aneoconsulting/ArmoniK/blob/main/infrastructure/utils/scripts/installation/prerequisites-installer.sh) from the root repository.

```bash
./infrastructure/utils/scripts/installation/prerequisites-installer.sh
```

::alert{type="info"}
Please, read the script before running it and make sure to have Docker Desktop disabled if you are on Windows.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
We do not recommend you to manually install the pre-requisites for compatibility reasons. If you want to install them manually, please follow the prerequisites installer script.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
You could encounter some issues with the execution of the prerequisites installer script. Please verify you've right permissions on the script. If not, you can use `chmod +x <file|directory/*>` to add the execution permissions.

```sh
# Add execution permissions to the prerequisites installer script
chmod +x ./infrastructure/utils/scripts/installation/prerequisites-installer.sh
# Add execution permissions to every script in the prerequisites directory
chmod +x ./infrastructure/utils/scripts/installation/prerequisites/*
```

::alert{type="info"}
What is Docker? Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)).
::

### Helm

ArmoniK uses Helm to deploy applications. You must have Helm installed on your machine. You can follow the [official documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install Helm on your machine.

::alert{type="info"}
What is Helm? Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows developers and operators to more easily package, configure, and deploy applications and services onto Kubernetes clusters. [Read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm_(software)).
