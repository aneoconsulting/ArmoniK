# Prerequisites (Detailed)

Before installing ArmoniK locally or on-premise, ensure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

## Make

ArmoniK uses Make to run commands. See the [official documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
Make is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles, which specify how to derive the target program. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)).
```

## JQ

ArmoniK uses JQ to parse JSON. See the [official documentation](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
jq is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor used for pretty-printing JSON data, extracting specific values, and reformatting JSON documents. [Learn more](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
```

## Python3

ArmoniK uses Python3 to run scripts. See the [official documentation](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
Python is an interpreted, high-level general-purpose programming language that emphasizes code readability through significant whitespace and clear, logical syntax suitable for projects of all scales. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)).
```

## HCL2

ArmoniK uses HCL2 to parse Terraform files. See the [official documentation](https://pypi.org/project/python-hcl2/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
HCL is a configuration language created by HashiCorp and used by several of its products, including Terraform, Nomad, and Consul. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_(programming_language)).
```

## jsonpath-ng

ArmoniK uses jsonpath-ng to parse JSON. See the [official documentation](https://pypi.org/project/jsonpath-ng/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
jsonpath-ng is a Python implementation of JSONPath for querying JSON structures. [Learn more](https://pypi.org/project/jsonpath-ng/).
```

## Terraform

ArmoniK uses Terraform to deploy infrastructure. See the [official documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for installation instructions.

```{note}
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool created by HashiCorp that uses declarative configuration language (HCL or JSON) to define and manage data center infrastructure across various service providers and custom solutions. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)).
```

## Docker

ArmoniK uses Docker to run containers. See the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
Docker is a containerization platform that uses OS-level virtualization to package software with its dependencies into isolated containers. Containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines since they share the operating system kernel while remaining isolated from one another. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)).
```

## Helm

ArmoniK uses Helm to deploy applications. See the [official documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies packaging, configuring, and deploying applications and services onto Kubernetes clusters. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helm_(software)).
```


## Kubectl

ArmoniK uses Kubectl to manage Kubernetes. See the [official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/) for installation instructions.

```{note}
Kubectl is a command-line tool for controlling and managing Kubernetes clusters. [Learn more](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/).
