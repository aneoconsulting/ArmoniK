# Getting Started with ArmoniK

Welcome to the ArmoniK documentation! This guide will help you get started with installing, configuring, and deploying ArmoniK on various platforms. Below, you'll find links to detailed guides for each of them.

First, you'll have to install ArmoniK's [Prerequisites](../getting-started/installation/prerequisites.md).

Then, you will have the choice to either deploy on your local machine, on an existing Kubernetes cluster, on AWS, or on GCP. The steps to do so are available in the following sections. The last step is to check that everything is working.

## Installation on your Machine

Learn how to set up ArmoniK on your machine:

- [Local Deployment](../getting-started/installation/local.md): Deploy ArmoniK locally for development purposes. It installs a local K3s on which ArmoniK will deployed.

## Installation on a Kubernetes Cluster

Learn how to set up ArmoniK on Kubernetes:

- [Kubernetes Deployment](../getting-started/installation/kubernetes.md): Install ArmoniK on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation on AWS

Learn how to set up ArmoniK on AWS. This deploys ArmoniK and all its dependencies on AWS including Kubernetes (EKS).

- [AWS Deployment](../getting-started/installation/aws.md): Set up and deploy ArmoniK on Amazon Web Services.

## Installation on GCP

Learn how to set up ArmoniK on GCP. This deploys ArmoniK and all its dependencies on GCP including Kubernetes (GKE).

- [GCP Deployment](../getting-started/installation/gcp.md): Deploy ArmoniK on Google Cloud Platform.

## Setup Validation

Once ArmoniK is installed, learn how to execute tasks and manage workflows:

- [Check Installation](../getting-started/execution/check.md): Verify that your installation is working correctly.
- [Launch HelloWorld Sample](../getting-started/execution/how-to-launch-HelloWorld-Sample.md): Run a simple example to get started.
- [Use HTC Mock](../getting-started/execution/how-to-use-htc-mock.md): Simulate high-throughput computing scenarios.
